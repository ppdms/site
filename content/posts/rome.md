I took these images in Rome, where I spent one week as one of three Greek university students selected to compete at the 2024 European Huawei Seeds for the Future startup competition. We worked hard, had fun, and learned about technology, leadership and entrepreneurship from industry leaders and distinguished mentors. I'm incredibly grateful for this learning opportunity and I canâ€™t wait to apply the knowledge I've gained to my future career!
